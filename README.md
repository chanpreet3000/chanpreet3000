# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chanpreet Singh

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub. I'm an upcoming Software Engineer at Atlassian, where I'll probably spend my time
figuring out how to break (and then fix) things in the coolest way possible.

## About Me ðŸ™ƒ

- **Coding**: I dive into web development, game dev, Android apps, and automation scripts when life gets
  overwhelming. Itâ€™s my way of keeping busy and building cool stuff along the way.
- **Competitive Coding**:  I got addicted to solving problems on platforms like Codeforces
  and LeetCode. It was fun while it lasted, but these days, I prefer creating solutions instead of just finding them.
- **Gaming Nerd**: Valorant, Minecraft, GTA, Rocket League, name it, and Iâ€™ve probably spent way too many hours
  playing it. Gaming is my way of unwinding and pretending Iâ€™m not just staring at another screen.
- **Freelancing on Upwork**: Iâ€™m an automation enthusiast and developer specializing in web scraping, browser
  automation, and API integrations. On Upwork, Iâ€™ve worked with clients worldwide to create clean, maintainable scripts
  using tools like Puppeteer, Selenium, Playwright, and more. Whether itâ€™s data scraping, automating complex workflows,
  or building efficient systems, I enjoy delivering solutions that are robust and future-proof. Plus, I make sure my
  code is well-documented and ready for deployment (including on EC2).

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

Mostly personal projects, automation scripts, and random experiments. My code is clean (most of the time), and I try to
keep it organized, but hey, itâ€™s a work in progress just like me.
