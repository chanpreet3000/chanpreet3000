Hi, My name is Chanpreet Singh. Currentlty I'm pursuing BTech from NSUT 2024.

I have interest in coding. It started when i started using unity for Game Development and created many games most are on the github and PlayStore. 
Now I'm learning Android Development and trying to improve daily.

I am currently looking to collaborate with anyone with Android Development knowledge just to get some experience and get better at it.
